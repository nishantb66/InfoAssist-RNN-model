# InfoAssist-RNN-model

## Project Overview
InfoAssist-RNN-model is a chatbot application designed to assist users by answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) and providing support for various queries related to a software product. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

## Model Details

### RNN and LSTM Model
The chatbot uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to process and understand the context of the queries. The model architecture includes:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
2. **Bidirectional LSTM Layers**: Captures information from both past and future states.
3. **Dropout Layers**: Reduces overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training.
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
5. **Softmax Layer**: Outputs the probability distribution over the classes.

### Training and Performance
The model is trained on a dataset of FAQs (`dialogs.txt`) using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting. 

- **Accuracy**: The model achieves an accuracy of 82% on the training data.
- **Loss**: The training loss is 0.83.

### Capabilities
- **Answering FAQs**: Provides accurate responses to frequently asked questions.
- **Alternative Questions**: Suggests alternative questions if the initial response is not satisfactory.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user feedback to improve responses.
- **Retraining**: Supports retraining with new data to improve accuracy and relevance.

### Scope for Improvements
1. **Data Augmentation**: Increase the dataset size by adding more diverse and comprehensive questions and answers.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimize learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
3. **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Implement transformers or attention mechanisms for better context understanding.
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Continuously improve the model based on user interactions and feedback.
5. **Multilingual Support**: Extend the model to support multiple languages.
